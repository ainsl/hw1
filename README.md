cca computational practices 1 – week 1 homework

I included several experiments I did in the bubbles program and explained what I changed in the code:
  - making the bubble bigger
  - changing the color of the bubble
  - changing the motion of the bubble
  - making the bubble smaller
  - changing the stroke on the bubble
  - changing the bubble's destination when the mouse is pressed
  
I included a file where I answered the questions posted on the class site:
  - What do the numbers inside the parentheses after a function name do?
  - What’s the difference between fill and stroke?
  - What is the keyboard shortcut to open the JavaScript console in Chrome on your system?
  
And I included a screenshot of the Chrome console showing a site with errors.
